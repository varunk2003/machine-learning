   <center><h1>Definition</h1></center>
   <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of data and statistical techniques to improve a system's performance on a specific task over time.
   </p>
<h1>Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three types:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Supervised ML</li>
    <li>Unsupervised ML</li>
    <li>Reinforcement ML</li>
    
</ol>
<center><h1>Supervised Machine Learning</h1></center>
<center><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/supervised-machine-learning.png" alt="s-image"></center>
<p>In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the corresponding correct output. The goal is for the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include classification and regression tasks.</p>
<h1>Main Types of Supervised Machine Learning</h1>
<ol>
    <li>classification</li>
    <li>Regression</li>

    
</ol>
<h1>Classification</h1>
<center><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/classification-algorithm-in-machine-learning.png" alt="Random Image" class ="c-image"></center>
<p>Classification is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict the categorical class label of an input data point. In other words, the algorithm learns to assign input data to one of several predefined classes. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam, identifying types of animals based on their features, or classifying images of digits into their corresponding numbers (0-9) are all examples of classification tasks.</p>
<h1>Metrics used in classification</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Accurac</li>
    <li>Precision</li>
    <li>Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)</li>
    <li>F1-Score</li>
    <li>Confusion Matrix</li>
    <li>ROC Curve and AUC</li>

    
</ol>












<h1>Regression</h1>

<center><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/types-of-regression2.png" alt="Random Image" class ="r-image"></center>
<p>Regression is another type of supervised learning task that involves predicting a continuous numeric value based on input data. In regression, the algorithm learns to model the relationship between the input variables and the target variable to make accurate predictions. Examples of regression tasks include predicting house prices based on features like square footage and location, estimating a person's age based on certain biological markers, or forecasting sales figures based on historical data.</p>
<center><h1>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h1></center>
<center><img src="https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/Unsupervised-Learning-in-ML-1.jpg" alt="Random Image" class="un-image"></center>







<p> Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the algorithm's objective is to identify patterns or relationships within the data without explicit output labels. Common techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation. This type of learning is often used for tasks like customer segmentation or anomaly detection.</p>
<h1>Metrics used in Regression</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</li>
    <li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
    <li>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</li>
    <li>R-squared (Coefficient of Determination</li>
   

    
</ol>
<center><h1>Reinforcement Machine Learning</h1></center>
<center><img src="https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Reinforcement-Learning-in-ML-TV.jpg" alt="Random Image" class="ir-image"></center>
<p>Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning how to interact with an environment in order to maximize a reward. The agent takes actions and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to learn through trial and error. Applications include game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.</p>
<center><h1>The machine learning process generally involves the following steps:</h1></center>
<ol>
    <li>Data Collection</li>
    <li>Data Preprocessin</li>
    <li>Feature Engineering</li>
    <li>Model Selection</li>
    <li>Model Training</li>
    <li>Model Evaluation</li>
    <li>Model Tuning</li>
    <li>Deployment</li>
    
</ol>
<h1>Data Collection</h1>
<p>Gathering relevant and high-quality data for training and evaluation.</p>
<h1>Data Preprocessin</h1>
<p>Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for training.</p>
<h1>Feature Engineering</h1>
<p>Selecting, extracting, or creating meaningful features from the data to improve model performance.</p>
<h1>Model Selection</h1>
<p> Choosing an appropriate algorithm or model architecture based on the problem and the data.</p>
<h1>Model Training</h1>
<p> Feeding the algorithm with the training data and adjusting its parameters to learn the underlying patterns.</p>
<h1>Model Evaluation</h1>
<p>Assessing the model's performance using validation or test data to measure its accuracy and generalization ability.</p>
<h1>Model Tuning</h1>
<p>Adjusting hyperparameters and refining the model to achieve better results.</p>
<h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>Integrating the trained model into a real-world application for making predictions or decisions.</p>
<center><h1>Decision Tree</h1></center>

<p>A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome or class label. Decision trees are particularly intuitive and easy to understand, making them useful for visualizing decision-making processes.</p>
<center><h1>Random Forest</h1></center>

<p>
    Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the overall performance and robustness of the model. It's used for both classification and regression tasks and is particularly effective in handling complex and high-dimensional datasets.</p>
<h1>Ensemble Learning</h1>
<p>Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that involves combining the predictions of multiple individual models (learners) to create a stronger and more accurate model. The idea behind ensemble learning is that by aggregating the predictions of multiple models, the ensemble can overcome the limitations of individual models and improve overall performance, robustness, and generalization.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bagging</li>
    <li>Boosting</li>


    <center><h1>Support Vector Machine</h1></center>
    <img src="https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/SVM_1.jpg" alt="Random Image">
    <p>A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs are particularly effective when dealing with complex data that is not linearly separable. They work by finding a hyperplane that best separates different classes of data or predicts the target variable.</p>
    <h1>Here's how an SVM works</h1>

    <ol>
    <li>Hyperplane</li>
    <p>In a binary classification problem, the SVM searches for a hyperplane that best separates the two classes while maximizing the margin between the classes. The hyperplane is the decision boundary that classifies new data points.</p>
    <li>Margin</li>
    <p>The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes this margin. This is important because a larger margin usually leads to better generalization on unseen data.</p>
    <li>Support Vectors</li>
    <p>The data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors. These points are crucial in determining the position and orientation of the hyperplane. SVM focuses on the support vectors to create a robust decision boundary.</p>
    <li>Kernel Trick</li>
    <p>SVMs can transform the original input data into a higher-dimensional space using a mathematical function called a kernel. This transformation can make the data linearly separable in the higher-dimensional space even if it wasn't in the original space. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.</p>
